# TiGB Al–V Segregation Project (Under Construction)

This repository is **under construction**. It currently contains the **data and analysis code** needed to reproduce the DFT-based segregation-profile analysis associated with:

- **Acta Materialia** (2026): *Quantifying changes to solute segregation behaviour at interfaces in additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V*

## What’s in here

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for parsing VASP calculations and producing analysis-ready tables/datasets.
- **`outputs/`** (generated): Pickles/CSVs and structure files exported from the notebooks.
- **`environment.yml`**: Conda environment definition for running the notebooks.

## Status

- Data is present but analysis tools are missing at the moment.
