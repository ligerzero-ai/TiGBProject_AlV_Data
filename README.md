This repository is **under construction**. It currently contains the **data and analysis code** needed to reproduce the DFT-based segregation-profile analysis associated with:

- **Acta Materialia** (2026): *“…”*  
  Reference link: `https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645426000108`

## What’s in here

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for parsing VASP calculations and producing analysis-ready tables/datasets.
- **`outputs/`** (generated): Pickles/CSVs and structure files exported from the notebooks.
- **`environment.yml`**: Conda environment definition for running the notebooks.

## Status

- Parsing/export utilities are functional, but the repository layout and documentation are still evolving.
